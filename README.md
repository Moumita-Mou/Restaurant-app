# Restaurant App

**Restaurant App** is a simple, static mobile app that mimics the look and feel of a restaurant interface. The app is built using the [Expo](https://expo.dev/) framework for mobile development and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for backend logic. Although it is not fully functional and operates more like a static webpage, it serves as a template for future expansion.

## Features

- **Static Interface**: The app provides a restaurant-themed user interface with placeholder elements such as menus, restaurant information, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile viewing.
- **Expo Framework**: Easy to run and test on mobile devices using Expo.
- **Node.js Integration**: Backend logic placeholder, ready for future functionality.

## Installation

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Moumita-Mou/Restaurant-App.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Restaurant-App
   ```

3. Since the `node_modules` folder is not included, you will need to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Install Expo CLI globally if itâ€™s not installed already:

   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

5. Start the Expo development server:

   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

6. You can now open the app on your mobile device using the Expo Go app or in a simulator.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the following dependencies:

- **Expo**: The app is built using Expo for mobile development.
- **Node.js**: Backend logic placeholder for future functionality.
- All additional dependencies will be installed via `npm install`.

## Current Status

- The app is **not fully functional** and behaves more like a **static webpage** with restaurant-related visuals and basic navigation.
- Currently, no dynamic or interactive features are implemented.
- Future updates may include functionality like food ordering, reservation handling, and more.

## Future Plans

- Add backend functionality for handling orders and reservations.
- Integrate with a real database to make the app fully operational.
- Implement user authentication and payment systems.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can navigate through static restaurant-related pages, including:

- Menu page (static, non-interactive).
- About Us section with restaurant information.
- Placeholder navigation for other restaurant services.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure to install all dependencies using `npm install`.
2. If Expo is not working as expected, try clearing the cache:

   ```bash
   expo start -c
   ```

3. Check your Node.js installation by running:

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
